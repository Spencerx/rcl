=rcl:include=

The ''rcl:include'' tag is used to include a resource within an XML document.

When the RCL processing service encounters a ''rcl:include'' tag it examines
the child elements to determine how to process the inclusion.
The target of the include operation is either the ''rcl:include'' tag
itself or, if a ''rcl:xpath'' tag is a child element, the target is
specified by the XPath expression.
In either case, the ''rcl:include'' tag is removed from the XML document.

=Syntax=

The ''rcl:include'' tag is in the ''http://netkernelroc.org/rcl'' namespace.
In its simplest form, it contains ony non-namespace elements:

{xml}<div xmlns:rcl="http://netkernel.org/rcl">
<rcl:include>
<h3>Include This Section</h3>
<p>This paragraph is included within the containing div element.</p>
</rcl:include>
</div>{/xml}

The result of processing this ''rcl:include'' tag is:

{xml}<div>
<h3>Include This Section</h3>
<p>This paragraph is included within the containing div element.</p>
</div>{/xml}

Notice that the ''rcl:include'' tag itself and all references to the RCL namespace
are removed from the resulting document.

==xpath==

{authornote}Note: the ''rcl:xpath'' tag is not yet implemented.{/authornote}


If the ''rcl:xpath'' tag is a child element it specifies the location of the
include substitution.



{xml}<div xmlns:rcl="http://netkernel.org/rcl">
<rcl:include>
<rcl:xpath></rcl:xpath>
<h3>Include This Section</h3>
<p>This paragraph is included within the containing div element.</p>
</rcl:include>
</div>{/xml}


==request==

The ''rcl:request'' child element specifies a request
for a resource representation which, when returned, is added to
the set of other XML child elements.
After processing the ''rcl:request'' tag, the whole set of child
elements if either included either
inline or as specified by the optional ''rcl:xpath'' tag.

Within the ''rcl:include'' tag it is permissble to have multiple
''rcl:request'' tags.




The first example illustrates a rcl:include tag replaced by the
requested resource representation.
The following template:

{xml}<div xmlns:rcl="http://netkernel.org/rcl">
<h1>Header</h1>
<rcl:include>
<rcl:request>
<rcl:identifier>res:/resource/detail.xml</rcl:identifier>
</rcl:request>
</rcl:include>
</div>{/xml}

requests the resource ''res:/resource/detail.xml'' which contains:

{xml}<p>This is detail information</p>{/xml}

After the requested resource representation replaces the rcl:include tag
and the namespace attribute is removed,
the result is the following XML document:

{xml}<div>
<h1>Header</h1>
<p>This is detail information</p></div>{/xml}

{ignore}

=== Return Types ===

The return type of the request determines how the processing happens...

org.w3c.dom.Document

java.lang.String

xxx.IHDSNode

java.lang.Boolean?

{/ignore}
