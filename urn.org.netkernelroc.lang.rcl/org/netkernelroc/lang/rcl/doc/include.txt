=rcl:include=

The ''rcl:include'' tag is used to include a resource within an XML document.

The ''rcl:include'' tag must include a ''rcl:request'' tag which specifies a
[[doc:logicalreference:module:standard:logical:declarative:request:syntax|declarative request]].
When the request is processed, the returned representation is placed in
the XML document.
If the optional ''rcl:xpath'' tag is present it specifies the location within the
XML document where the replacement occurs. If the ''rcl:xpath'' tag is
absent then the enclosing ''rcl:include'' tag is the replacement target.
After processing, the rcl:include tag and the namespace attribute are
removed from the resulting XML document.

Note: the ''rcl:xpath'' tag is not yet implemented.

The first example illustrates a rcl:include tag replaced by the
requested resource representation.
The following template:

{xml}<div xmlns:rcl="http://netkernel.org/rcl">
<h1>Header</h1>
<rcl:include>
<rcl:request>
<rcl:identifier>res:/resource/detail.xml</rcl:identifier>
</rcl:request>
</rcl:include>
</div>{/xml}

requests the resource ''res:/resource/detail.xml'' which contains:

{xml}<p>This is detail information</p>{/xml}

After the requested resource representation replaces the rcl:include tag
and the namespace attribute is removed,
the result is the following XML document:

{xml}<div>
<h1>Header</h1>
<p>This is detail information</p></div>{/xml}
